# Algorithms in C

## Description
This repository contains implementations of various algorithms written in C, including searching, sorting, and other foundational computational methods. Each algorithm is provided as a separate, well-documented file, making it easy to study and understand their workings. These algorithms serve as essential tools for computer science and programming applications.

## List of Algorithms

### Searching Algorithms
1. **Binary Search**: Efficiently finds an element in a sorted array using a divide-and-conquer approach.

### Sorting Algorithms
1. **Heap Sort**: Utilizes a heap data structure to sort elements.
2. **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
3. **Counting Sort**: Sorts elements by counting the frequency of each unique element.
4. **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct positions.
5. **Merge Sort**: Divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them.
6. **Quick Sort**: Divides the array into partitions and sorts them recursively.
7. **Selection Sort**: Selects the smallest element and places it at the beginning of the unsorted portion.

### Other Algorithms
1. **Chained Matrix Multiplication**: Efficiently multiplies a chain of matrices using dynamic programming.
2. **Floyd-Warshall**: Finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.
3. **KP Dynamic**: Solves the knapsack problem using dynamic programming.
4. **KP Greedy**: Solves the knapsack problem using a greedy approach.
5. **MC Dynamic**: Solves the matrix chain multiplication problem using dynamic programming.
6. **MC Greedy**: Solves the matrix chain multiplication problem using a greedy approach.
7. **Min-Max**: Implements the min-max algorithm for decision-making in games.
